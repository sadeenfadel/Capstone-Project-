## ‚öôÔ∏è5. Challenges & Solutions

During the development of the Flower Shop Web Application, several challenges were encountered and successfully addressed:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Relationships
**Challenge:**  
Establishing the correct relationships between models (User, Bouquet, Flower, and Order) using Django‚Äôs ORM was initially complex.  

**Solution:**  
Used `ForeignKey` and `ManyToManyField` with `through` tables (`BouquetFlower` and `OrderBouquet`) to clearly define how bouquets connect to flowers and orders. This ensured accurate data management and flexibility for future customization.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Image Handling
**Challenge:**  
Handling image uploads for bouquets and profiles while keeping the file names unique.  

**Solution:**  
Integrated **Pillow** for image management and implemented unique filenames using `uuid` or Django‚Äôs built-in upload structure to avoid overwriting existing images.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Order Logic
**Challenge:**  
Implementing a logical order flow (Pending ‚Üí Ready ‚Üí Confirmed) that works seamlessly between customer and admin views.  

**Solution:**  
Used conditional rendering in templates and clear status management in the `Order` model to ensure smooth updates between states.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Template & Design Consistency
**Challenge:**  
Maintaining consistent layout and responsive design across all templates.  

**Solution:**  
Created shared base templates and reused common UI components (headers, footers, cards) while adding custom CSS for responsiveness and uniformity.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Time Management
**Challenge:**  
Building the project within a short timeframe (one week) while balancing design, backend, and documentation.  

**Solution:**  
Followed an MVP-first approach ‚Äî focusing on core functionality first, then adding polish and enhancements later.
